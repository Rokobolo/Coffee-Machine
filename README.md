# Coffee-Machine
The Coffee Machine project has been created during the 15th Day of my Coding course.

## What does it do?
* The Machine will run and ask you to choose one of the 3 options.

* When choosing one of the 3 beverages, you will be asked to insert coins.

* If do not insert enough coins, the machine will "refund" and ask you to insert the coins again.

* Once the money has been processed, the machine will deliver you your beverage.
* If you insert too many coins, the machine will calculate and refund the excess.

* Behind the scene the machine will remove the resources that were used to make the coffee from its containers and add the money to the dedicated place.
* If the resources turn out to be too low to make one of the choice, the machine will print an error message asking to refill the missing ingredients.

* Additionnally typing "report" instead of choosing a coffee will print give visibility on the resources left and the money counter.
